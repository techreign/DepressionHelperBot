REDDIT BOT

WHAT IT DOES:
Scans through reddit submissions looking for original posts where the user seems to
be suicidal or depressed and posts something motivational in that thread. Also, checks
old comments to see if they were taken negatively (downvoted) and removes them.


HOW TO USE:
-You need to install PRAW (reddit api)
 pip install praw on the command line terminal
- modify the my.ini file and fill in your own credentials
- run the program

TO DO:
A lot! This was mostly a learning experience and there are many optimization, formatting,
syntax, DRY, add ons and more that can be done. I will be continuing with more
bots in the future, but this was a fun and eventful learning experience!
